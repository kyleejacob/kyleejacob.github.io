<p> Hi! My name is Kylee Jacob and as I stated before I am a first year student at the University of Maine at Orono. I chose to major in business because I feel like it is very broad and would help me in any career path I end up choosing.    </p>

<p> I grew up in Waterboro, Maine and graduated from Massabesic High School this past year. In my house it was just my parents, my three dogs, and myself. Being an only child has definitely been the greatest thing ever and I don't think I have ever complained about it. As I just mentioned, I have three dogs and I love each of them with my whole heart. Their names are Winnie, Oliver, and Coco and they're all small cute fluffy little dogs with personalities bigger than them. If you check out my photo gallery you will see a photo of them! </p>

<p> A few of my favorite things are pasta, the color pink, shopping, and traveling. Thankfully I have been so lucky to be able to travel since I was very little and I have been all over the country, as well as 3 other countries. My parents love going new places and have always brought me along for the journey. One of my out-of-country experiences was through Girl Scouts, which I was a part of from the age of five until I had to graduate at eighteen years old. The bonds I created with the girls in my troop and my leader are those that will last a lifetime. Girl Scouts introduced me with the important concepts of leadership, friendship, and teamwork which has helped me tremendously while growing up. </p> 

<p> Eventually, I would love to be my own boss. Owning a business is my long term goal and I have confidence that I will be able to after completing school at the University of Maine and acquiring my bachelors degree in business.
